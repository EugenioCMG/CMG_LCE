## Abstract

The **Coherence–Energy Law (LCE)**:  
\[
\boxed{\dot{\rho}_\Psi = -\mu \dot{\Psi} \ddot{\Psi}}
\]  
is the central equation of **Magnetogravitational Cosmology (CMG-LCE)**. This document presents its conceptual derivation, physical interpretation, analogies with electrodynamics, applications to 3I/ATLAS, and falsifiable predictions. The LCE unifies electromagnetism and gravity through a single field: the **coherent memory of the vacuum**.

## 1. Introduction

The **Coherence–Energy Law (LCE)** establishes that the rate of change of coherent energy density in the vacuum (\(\dot{\rho}_\Psi\)) depends on the dynamics of the electromagnetic memory field of the vacuum (\(\Psi\)):

\[
\dot{\rho}_\Psi = -\mu \dot{\Psi} \ddot{\Psi}
\]

Where:  
- \(\dot{\rho}_\Psi\): Rate of energy transfer to the vacuum (W/m³)  
- \(\mu\): Magnetogravitational coupling constant  
- \(\dot{\Psi}\): Coherence velocity  
- \(\ddot{\Psi}\): Coherence acceleration

## 2. Physical Interpretation

| Term | Meaning | Analogy |
|------|--------|--------|
| \(\dot{\Psi}\) | Rate of change of \(\Psi\) | Memory current |
| \(\ddot{\Psi}\) | Acceleration of \(\Psi\) | Memory force |
| \(-\mu \dot{\Psi} \ddot{\Psi}\) | Energy flux to vacuum | \(\vec{J} \cdot \vec{E}\) |

**Table 1**: Analogy with electrodynamics.

## Abstract

We present the complete mathematical derivation of the **Coherence–Energy Law (LCE)**:

\[
\boxed{\dot{\rho}_\Psi = -\mu \dot{\Psi} \ddot{\Psi}}
\]

from fundamental principles of energy conservation, extended gauge symmetry, and nonlinear coupling between the electromagnetic memory field of the vacuum \(\Psi\) and gravitational curvature. The LCE emerges as a local continuity equation in a hybrid thermodynamic–geometric system, where electromagnetic coherence acts as a fluid with memory. We demonstrate dimensional consistency, dynamic stability, and reduction to General Relativity and Maxwell’s equations in appropriate limits.

## 1. Fundamental Postulates

**Definition 1 (Vacuum Memory Field)**. The field \(\Psi\) is a scalar–tensorial order parameter that encodes the history of electromagnetic coherence in the vacuum:

\[
\Psi = \Psi(x,t) \in \mathbb{R} \quad \text{or} \quad \Psi_{\mu\nu}(x,t) \in T^*M \otimes T^*M
\]

**Definition 2 (Vacuum Susceptibility)**. The vacuum responds to electromagnetic perturbations with susceptibility \(\mu > 0\):

\[
\mu \in \mathbb{R}^+, \quad [\mu] = s^2
\]

## 2. Extended Action of the System

The total action of the system is:

\[
S = S_{\text{EH}} + S_{\text{Maxwell}} + S_\Psi + S_{\text{int}}
\]

where:

\[
S_{\text{EH}} = \frac{1}{16\pi G} \int \sqrt{-g}\, R \, d^4x \tag{1}
\]

\[
S_{\text{Maxwell}} = -\frac{1}{4} \int \sqrt{-g}\, F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} \, d^4x \tag{2}
\]

\[
S_\Psi = \int \sqrt{-g} \left( \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu \Psi \partial^\mu \Psi - V(\Psi) \right) d^4x \tag{3}
\]

\[
S_{\text{int}} = \int \sqrt{-g} \left[ \mu \Psi \cdot \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{2} F_{\alpha\beta} F^{\alpha\beta} \right) \right] d^4x \tag{4}
\]
